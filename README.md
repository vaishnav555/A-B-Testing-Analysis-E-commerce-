# A-B-Testing-Analysis-E-commerce-
The objective of this Python task is to perform an A/B testing analysis on an e-commerce marketing dataset to evaluate whether a new variant (Test group) performs better than the existing version (Control group) in terms of conversion rate. The analysis uses statistical methods to make a data-driven business decision.

🔍 Analytical Approach

Segmented users into Control (A) and Test (B) groups based on experiment assignment.
Defined clear null and alternative hypotheses to avoid biased conclusions.
Selected appropriate statistical tests based on data type:
Chi-square test for binary conversion outcomes.
Confidence interval estimation to measure the magnitude and reliability of observed differences.
Used alpha = 0.05 to maintain standard statistical rigor.

📊 Insights & Interpretation

Compared conversion rates across experiment groups to evaluate performance uplift.
Assessed statistical significance using p-values rather than intuition.
Quantified uncertainty using 95% confidence intervals, ensuring decisions are supported by reliable estimates rather than raw averages.
Visualized distributions and group-level metrics to enhance interpretability for non-technical stakeholders.

💡 Business Impact

Prevents premature rollout of ineffective product or marketing changes.
Helps optimize customer experience using evidence-based decisions.
Demonstrates how data science supports product strategy, growth optimization, and ROI improvement.
